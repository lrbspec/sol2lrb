# sol2lrb
sol2lrb is a(n in-progress) track converter from beta 6.2 `.sol` tracks to `.lrb`.

it serves as the following:
- a reference implementation of `.lrb` writing
- a tool for archival purposes (output something accurate to the original `.sol` in a binary format that is more compact & explicit)
- a good reference for how `.sol` tracks are read from scratch

it is written in zig 0.14.0
